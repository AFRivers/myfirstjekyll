# Markdown tutorial

Markdown performs many of the same functions as HTML, but in a simpler form. You can create headers in different sizes:

``` # H1
```
# Header 1

``` ## H2
```
## Header 2

``` ### H3
```
### Header 3

You can make text *italicized* or **bold**.

``` *To italicize text, surround it with single asterisks.* **To bold text, use two.**
```

You can also create bulleted lists.
+ They will look like this.

```
+ You can use a plus sign
- Or a dash
* Or an asterisk to create your bullet points
```

Markdown can be used to create [links](http://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/cat/8dd94a01d2).

```
[Bracket the text you want hyperlinked and put the URL in parentheses, like this.](http://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/cat/8dd94a01d2)
```
