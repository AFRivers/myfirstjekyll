# Markdown tutorial

Markdown performs many of the same functions as HTML, but in a simpler form. You can create headers in different sizes:

# Header 1

```
# Use a hash to tell Markdown to create a header
```

## Header 2

```
## More hashes will give you a smaller header
```

### Header 3

```
### Header 3
```

---

You can make text *italicized* or **bold**.

```
*To italicize text, surround it with single asterisks.* **To bold text, use two.**
```

---

You can also create bulleted lists.

+ They will look like this.


```
+ You can use a plus sign
- Or a dash
* Or an asterisk to create your bullet points
+ Make sure you leave a space between the bullet and the text
```

Markdown can be used to create [links](http://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/cat/8dd94a01d2).

```
[Bracket the text you want hyperlinked and put the URL in parentheses, like this.](http://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/cat/8dd94a01d2)
```
